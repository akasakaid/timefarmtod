# How to Get Data

So the way to get the data needed is the same as the bot script program that I have made before, for example [blumtod](https://github.com/akasakaid/blumtod). the data is entered into the data.txt file, one line contains 1 account data. 

Example of data needed

```
query_id=xxxxxxxxxx&user=xxxxxxfirst_namexxxxxlast_namexxxxxxxusernamexxxxxxxlanguage_codexxxxxxxallows_write_to_pmxxxxxxx&auth_date=xxxxxx&hash=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If you want to add more account than this is how

```
query_id=xxxxxxxxxx&user=xxxxxxfirst_namexxxxxlast_namexxxxxxxusernamexxxxxxxlanguage_codexxxxxxxallows_write_to_pmxxxxxxx&auth_date=xxxxxx&hash=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
query_id=xxxxxxxxxx&user=xxxxxxfirst_namexxxxxlast_namexxxxxxxusernamexxxxxxxlanguage_codexxxxxxxallows_write_to_pmxxxxxxx&auth_date=xxxxxx&hash=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
